# Practicing design patterns

This is most likely a project i will keep coming back later to for practice. No plans on fully learning all of these patterns at once.

With intent to improve as a developer, to show willingness to learn, skill level and motivation to future employers and maybe to help other people. I created this repo to document my practice with design patterns, how to integrate and utilize them while documenting my progress and thoughts. The project folders contain more documentation and simple TypeScript code that should demonstrate the design patterns.

**DISCLAIMER:** The documentation and examples may be similar or heavily influenced by [Refactoring Guru](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns) as this is the main resource i used for learning! I am NOT trying to pass any of this as my own. My only goal is to internalize what I'm practicing.

## Plan

I found [this comment](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/45044/recommended-order-for-learning-design-patterns#:~:text=But%20when%20you%20want%20to,all%20the%20order%20you%20need.) to a question i had when starting out. Out of all these patterns to learn, which ones do i start with? So my plan is to go down the list in the specified comment and start learning. I have also added this list in the order.md file in case the original comment is no longer there.

## Documentation

I have included documentation of each design pattern in a readme file located in it's corresponding folder.\
I'll also include a simple "how to" on running these projects.
